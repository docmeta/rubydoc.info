RubyDoc.info: YARD Doc Server
===============================

RubyDoc.info is the next generation Ruby doc server, replacing
[http://rdoc.info](http://rdoc.info) and
[http://yardoc.org/docs](http://yardoc.org/docs).
This doc server uses YARD to generate project documentation on the fly, for
both published RubyGems as well as GitHub projects.

The public doc server is hosted at [http://rubydoc.info](http://rubydoc.info)
