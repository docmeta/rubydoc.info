# RubyDoc.info: YARD Doc Server

RubyDoc.info is the next generation Ruby doc server, replacing
[http://rdoc.info](http://rdoc.info) and
[http://yardoc.org/docs](http://yardoc.org/docs).
This doc server uses YARD to generate project documentation on the fly, for
both published RubyGems as well as GitHub projects.

The public doc server is hosted at [http://www.rubydoc.info](http://www.rubydoc.info)

## Getting Started

This site is a public service and is community-supported. Patches and
enhancements are welcome.

Running the doc server locally is easy:

```sh
git clone git://github.com/lsegal/rubydoc.info
cd rubydoc.info
bundle install
cp config/config.yaml.sample config/config.yaml
bundle exec rake gems:update
bundle exec rake server:start
```

This will start a daemonized process, you can stop the server with:

```sh
bundle exec rake server:stop
```

### Running With Docker

If you have Docker installed, you can get started using `docker-compose`:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Add `-d` to daemonize the process. To stop the server in daemonized mode,
run `docker-compose down`.
